To ensure all software is functional, I did iterative testing as each method was created. I followed the needs of the software closely to ensure that everything was addressed. As JUnit testing was required for this software, I created tests that checked every reuirement of the code. This testing automatically checks the security of the program, but manual security checks were also done. I made sure to keep OOP principles in mind for maintainability, readability, and overall ease of editing while creating the program. I interpret user needs by going over the software requirements and thinking about the applications of these requirements. Understanding why the requirement is there can help you understand what the user will need. When designing software, I think about the requirements of the client and of the user. Then, I begin addressing each requirement step-by-step and testing iteratively. This makes it easy to ensure that you are creating exactly what the client needs.
